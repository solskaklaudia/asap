Have the person sit down, rest, and try to keep calm.
Loosen any tight clothing.
Ask if the person takes any chest pain medicine, such as nitroglycerin, for a known heart condition, and help them take it.
If the pain does not go away promptly with rest or within 3 minutes of taking nitroglycerin, call for emergency medical help.
If the person is unconscious and unresponsive, call 911 or the local emergency number, then begin CPR.
If an infant or child is unconscious and unresponsive, perform 1 minute of CPR, then call 911 or the local emergency number. 
DO NOT give the person anything by mouth unless a heart medicine (such as nitroglycerin) has been prescribed.
