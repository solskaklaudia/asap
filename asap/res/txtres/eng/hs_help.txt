If you suspect heatstroke, call 911 or your local emergency number.
Immediately move the person out of the heat, remove excess clothing, and cool them by whatever means available.
Let the person drink cool water to rehydrate if they're able.
Don't give sugary, caffeinated or alcoholic beverages to a person with heatstroke.
Begin CPR if the person loses consciousness and shows no signs of circulation, such as breathing, coughing or movement.
