Heat stroke
Heat stroke, also known as sun stroke, is a type of severe heat illness that results in a body temperature greater than 40.0 °C (104.0 °F) and confusion.

Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe hyperthermia and multiorgan-dysfunction resulting from exposure to heat. Medical complications may include seizures, rhabdomyolysis, or kidney failure.

Heat stroke occurs because of high external temperatures or physical exertion. Some people with certain health conditions are at an increased risk of heat stroke. It often occurs under prolonged exposure to extreme environmental or exertional heat, which is preventable in most individuals.

Preventive measures include drinking sufficient fluids and avoiding excessive heat. Treatment is by rapid physical cooling of the body and supportive care. Recommended methods include spraying the person with water and using a fan, putting the person in ice water, or giving cold intravenous fluids. While it is reasonable to add ice packs around a person, this by itself is not routinely recommended.
